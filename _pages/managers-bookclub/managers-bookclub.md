A few years ago I started a manager's book club at Google. It was the year I started managing people and I was terribly scared of the tasks. Many years later I'm still scared every day since *management is hard*!

The only way I know how to cope with that is by reading as many books as I can on the subject of management and leadership and try to learn every day to get a bit better at my job.

The club has now balooned to over 1000 members and it's been a great way for me to learn from books and also from other people's experience. It's been really amazing so here's the list of my top books and the highlights I took while reading the books.

A compreensive list of all the books I've read on this topic can found here: TBW
