My personal website built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Contains my contact info and social network links and I plan to add more posts and even port some old posts from Mediuum and Blogger.

Publishing to Github pages is done using a Github Action [workflow](https://github.com/micheleaiello/micheleaiello.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/jekyll.yml).
